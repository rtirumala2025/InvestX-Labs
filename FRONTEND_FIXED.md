# ✅ Frontend Issue Fixed!

## 🎉 Problem Resolved

The issue was a **port conflict** - there was another Node.js process running on port 3002, which is why you were seeing the WebSocket server interface instead of the React frontend.

## ✅ Current Status

### **Frontend (React App)**
- **URL**: http://localhost:3002
- **Status**: ✅ **NOW RUNNING CORRECTLY**
- **Content**: Your actual InvestX Labs React application

### **WebSocket Server**
- **URL**: ws://localhost:3003/ws
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:3003/
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3003/health
- **Status**: ✅ Running on correct port

## 🌐 Access Your Application

### **Main Application**
**Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3002**

You should now see:
- ✅ The actual InvestX Labs React application
- ✅ Dashboard with market data
- ✅ AI recommendations interface
- ✅ Chat functionality
- ✅ Portfolio management tools

### **WebSocket Server Interface** (for testing)
**http://localhost:3003/** - This is just for testing the WebSocket connection

## 🔧 What I Fixed

1. ✅ **Identified the port conflict** - Another process was using port 3002
2. ✅ **Killed the conflicting process** - Freed up port 3002
3. ✅ **Started the frontend properly** - Now running on port 3002
4. ✅ **Verified both services** - Frontend on 3002, WebSocket on 3003

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Open http://localhost:3002** - You should now see your actual React app
2. **Test the application** - Everything should work properly now
3. **Apply Supabase migration** - To fix the remaining 404 errors

Your InvestX Labs application is now running correctly on port 3002! 🚀
