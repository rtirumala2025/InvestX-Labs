    },
    sampleOutput: `Great question! Let me explain compound interest clearly:

**What it means:** Compound interest is when you earn interest on both your original money AND the interest you've already earned. It's like interest earning more interest!

**Why it matters:** This is how small amounts of money can grow into large amounts over time. Starting early gives you a huge advantage.

**Example:** Think of it like XP in a game - not only do you gain XP from battles, but your XP multiplier increases as you level up, so you gain even MORE XP from the same battles. That's compound interest! 🎮

If you save $50/month at 7% interest:
- After 1 year: ~$620
- After 5 years: ~$3,600
- After 10 years: ~$8,700

**Key Takeaways:**
- Start early to maximize growth
- Time is your biggest advantage
- Small amounts add up significantly

**Next Steps:** Try using an online compound interest calculator to experiment with different amounts and timeframes!`

      }
    },
    sampleOutput: `I appreciate your interest in college savings! Rather than recommending specific investments, let me help you understand the approach:

**General Strategy:** For college savings (3-5 years away), most financial experts suggest:

1. **Diversified Index Funds:** Spread risk across many companies (like VTI or VOO)
   - Pros: Low fees, automatic diversification, historically solid returns
   - Cons: Market volatility, no guarantees

2. **Target-Date Funds:** Automatically adjust risk as college approaches
   - Pros: Hands-off management, becomes more conservative over time
   - Cons: Slightly higher fees, less control

3. **Mix of Stocks and Bonds:** Balance growth with stability (70% stocks, 30% bonds)
   - Pros: Reduces volatility, protects gains
   - Cons: Lower potential returns than 100% stocks

**Recommended Platform for You:**
**Fidelity Youth Account** - Full market access, research tools, no fees
*Why:* Perfect for your age and goals, great educational resources
*Alternative:* Charles Schwab

**Getting Started:**
You're already investing $1,000! Consider:
- Adding $50-100/month from your $200 budget
- Keeping rest for emergency fund and spending
- Diversifying across 3-5 different funds or sectors

**Important:** Always discuss investment decisions with a parent or guardian. Consider starting with paper trading to practice first!

    sampleOutput: `Great job taking the first steps into investing! Let's analyze your portfolio from an educational perspective:

**What You're Doing Well:**
- You're actively learning and engaging with investments
- You're thinking about portfolio management early
- You've started with $500, which shows commitment
- Tech is an important sector to understand

**Learning Opportunities:**
- **Diversification:** Right now you're 100% in tech stocks. Think of it like training - you wouldn't only work on one skill! ⚽
  - Aim for 3-5 different sectors (tech, healthcare, consumer goods, etc.)
  - Consider adding an index fund for instant diversification

- **Risk Balance:** With moderate risk tolerance, consider:
  - 80-90% stocks across different sectors
  - 10-20% bonds or stable investments
  - This balances growth with stability

- **Long-term Thinking:** Focus on learning patterns, not daily price changes
  - Check monthly, not daily, to avoid emotional decisions
  - Track what you learn, not just what you earn

**Resources to Explore:**
- Investopedia's portfolio simulator
- Your platform's educational content
- Books: "The Simple Path to Wealth" (beginner-friendly)

**Remember:** Investing is a lifelong learning journey. Every decision teaches you something valuable! You're building great habits early.

        sampleOutput: `Great question! Let me explain diversification clearly:

**What it means:** Diversification is spreading your investments across different types of assets so you don't put all your eggs in one basket.

**Why it matters:** If one investment drops, others might stay stable or go up, protecting your overall portfolio.

**Example:** Think of it like not putting all your skill points into one stat in a game. If you only level up attack and face a boss that needs defense, you're in trouble! Same with investments - spread across different areas. 🎮

**Key Takeaways:**
- Reduces risk without eliminating potential gains
- Protects against any single investment failing
- Can be done easily with index funds

**Next Steps:** Look into index funds like VTI or VOO - they give you instant diversification across hundreds of companies!`

        expectedQueryType: 'suggestion',
        conversationContext: 'User just learned about diversification. They understand the concept and want practical steps.',
        sampleOutput: `Perfect! You're ready to apply what you learned about diversification. With $100, here's how people typically start:

**General Strategy:**

1. **Single Index Fund Approach** (Easiest for beginners)
   - Buy one broad market index fund (VTI, VOO, or SCHB)
   - Instant diversification across 500-3,500 companies
   - Pros: Simple, low fees ($0-3), automatic diversification
   - Cons: All in stocks (no bonds)

2. **Fractional Shares in Multiple Sectors**
   - Split $100 across 3-4 different sector ETFs
   - Example: $30 tech, $30 healthcare, $20 consumer, $20 finance
   - Pros: More control, learn about sectors
   - Cons: More complex, slightly higher fees

3. **Robo-Advisor** (Acorns, Betterment)
   - They automatically diversify for you
   - Pros: Hands-off, includes bonds
   - Cons: Monthly fees ($1-3)

**Recommended Platform for You:**
**Fidelity Youth Account** - No fees, fractional shares, great education
*Alternative:* Acorns (automatic diversification)

**Important:** Since you're 16, discuss this with a parent/guardian. Many platforms require parental approval for your age.

      },
      {
        input: 'What if I want to add more later?',
        expectedQueryType: 'education',
        conversationContext: 'User learned about diversification and starting with $100. Now asking about ongoing contributions.',
        sampleOutput: `Excellent question! You're thinking long-term, which is exactly right. Here's how ongoing contributions work:

**Dollar-Cost Averaging:**
This is the strategy of adding money regularly (weekly, monthly) regardless of market conditions.

**Why it works:**
- When prices are low, you buy more shares
- When prices are high, you buy fewer shares
- Over time, you average out the cost
- Removes emotion from investing decisions

**Example with Your Situation:**
If you add $20-50 monthly to your initial $100:
- Month 1: $100 (your start)
- Month 2: $120 (added $20)
- Month 3: $140 (added $20)
- After 1 year: $340 invested + growth!

**Keep Your Diversification:**
- If you started with an index fund, keep adding to it
- If you split across sectors, maintain your allocation
- Rebalance every 6-12 months if needed

**Pro Tip:** Set up automatic investments so you don't have to remember. Most platforms let you schedule recurring purchases.

**Remember:** Consistency beats timing the market. Small regular amounts build wealth over time - that's compound interest working for you! 💪`

    },
    sampleOutput: `I noticed you're asking about Tesla. I can teach you how to evaluate Tesla (or any stock), but I can't tell you whether to buy it. Let's learn how to analyze it together!

**Let's Learn Instead:**

**How to Evaluate Any Stock:**
1. **Company Fundamentals**
   - What does the company do?
   - Is it profitable?
   - How much debt does it have?
   - Who are its competitors?

2. **Financial Statements**
   - Revenue growth over time
   - Profit margins
   - Cash flow
   - P/E ratio (price compared to earnings)

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Industry trends
   - Competition
   - Regulatory risks
   - Market volatility

4. **Your Personal Fit**
   - Does it match your risk tolerance?
   - Do you understand the business?
   - Can you afford to lose this money?

**For Tesla Specifically:**
Research these questions:
- How is the EV market growing?
- What's Tesla's market share?
- Who are the competitors (Ford, GM, Rivian)?
- What do analysts say about valuation?

**Better Approach for Beginners:**
Instead of individual stocks, consider:
- Auto industry ETF (diversified across all car companies)
- Technology ETF (includes Tesla + others)
- Broad market index fund (includes Tesla as part of 500+ companies)

      }
    },
    sampleOutput: `Cryptocurrency is complex and volatile - not ideal for learning basics. Let me explain why and suggest better starting points:

**Why Crypto is Challenging for Beginners:**
- Extreme volatility (can drop 50%+ in days)
- Complex technology (blockchain, wallets, keys)
- Less regulation (fewer protections)
- Emotional rollercoaster (hard to learn when stressed)
- Many scams targeting young investors

**Better Starting Points:**
1. **Traditional Stocks and ETFs**
   - More predictable patterns
   - Easier to understand
   - Better educational resources
   - More regulatory protection

2. **Index Funds**
   - Instant diversification
   - Lower risk than individual stocks
   - Proven long-term track record
   - Simple to manage

3. **Savings Accounts and CDs**
   - Guaranteed returns
   - FDIC insured
   - Build emergency fund first
   - Learn without risk

**If You're Still Interested in Crypto:**
1. Learn the basics first (blockchain, how it works)
2. Start with stocks/ETFs to understand investing
3. Only invest what you can afford to lose completely
4. Wait until you're 18+ (most exchanges require it)
5. Talk to parents/guardians

**Recommended Learning Path:**
1. Master traditional investing first (6-12 months)
2. Build emergency fund
3. Then explore crypto with <5% of portfolio
4. Never invest money you need

These traditional investments are more beginner-friendly and have better educational resources. Interested in learning more about index funds or stocks?`

      }
    },
    sampleOutput: `Options trading is an advanced strategy that's not suitable for beginners. Let me explain why and suggest better alternatives:

**Why Options Aren't Right for Beginners:**
- Extremely complex (requires understanding of Greeks, expiration, strikes)
- High risk of losing 100% of investment
- Requires significant capital
- Time-sensitive (can expire worthless)
- Emotional stress (not good for learning)
- Most platforms require 18+ and experience

**Great Alternatives for Young Investors:**

1. **Long-term Buy-and-Hold Investing**
   - Buy quality companies/funds and hold for years
   - Less stressful, more time to learn
   - Historically 7-10% annual returns
   - Warren Buffett's recommended approach

2. **Index Fund Investing**
   - Diversified across hundreds of companies
   - Low fees, simple to understand
   - Proven track record
   - Perfect for beginners

3. **Dollar-Cost Averaging**
   - Invest small amounts regularly
   - Reduces risk of bad timing
   - Builds discipline
   - Compounds over time

4. **Building an Emergency Fund**
   - Save 3-6 months expenses
   - Foundation for all investing
   - Teaches discipline
   - Provides security

**Why These Are Better:**
- Lower risk, better for learning
- Build wealth steadily
- Less emotional stress
- More time to understand markets
- Appropriate for your age

**Focus on Learning:**
- How companies make money
- Reading financial statements
- Understanding market cycles
- Building good habits

You have decades to invest - there's no rush! Building a solid foundation now will serve you much better than trying to get rich quick.
