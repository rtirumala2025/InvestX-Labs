      <h2>Why Invest?</h2>
      <p>Investing is one of the most effective ways to build wealth over time. While saving money in a bank account is safe, it typically doesn't keep pace with inflation, meaning your money loses purchasing power over time.</p>
      
      <h2>Types of Investments</h2>
      <p>There are several types of investments to consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Ownership shares in companies</li>
        <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Loans to governments or corporations</li>
        <li><strong>Mutual Funds:</strong> Pooled investments managed by professionals</li>
        <li><strong>ETFs:</strong> Exchange-traded funds that track market indices</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>Here are the steps to begin your investment journey:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set clear financial goals</li>
        <li>Build an emergency fund</li>
        <li>Choose an investment account</li>
        <li>Start with index funds</li>
        <li>Invest regularly</li>
